# Malicious Router Attack Scenarios and Protection Mechanisms

## Overview
This document outlines various types of malicious router attacks that could target Uniswap V3's swap referrer fee system and the protection mechanisms implemented through the factory router whitelist system.

## Why Router Security Matters

Router contracts serve as intermediaries between users and Uniswap V3 pools, handling complex swap logic and fee distribution. When referrer fees are involved, routers gain the ability to direct portions of swap fees to specific addresses. This creates attack vectors that malicious actors can exploit to steal fees, manipulate transactions, or damage the protocol's reputation.

## Types of Malicious Router Attacks

### 1. **Hacked Router Contract**

#### Attack Description
A legitimate router contract that gets compromised through various attack vectors:
- **Smart contract vulnerabilities** (reentrancy, overflow, access control bugs)
- **Private key compromise** of router owner account
- **Upgrade mechanism exploit** in upgradeable proxy contracts
- **Governance token manipulation** for router control
- **Multi-sig wallet compromise** for router management

#### Attack Impact
- Attacker changes referrer address to their own wallet
- Diverts all swap referrer fees to attacker's address
- Users lose intended referrer rewards
- Protocol reputation damage
- Loss of user trust in the ecosystem

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Legitimate router before compromise
contract LegitimateRouter {
    address public swapReferrer = 0x...LegitimateReferrer;
    
    function setSwapReferrer(address _swapReferrer) external onlyOwner {
        swapReferrer = _swapReferrer;
    }
}

// After compromise - attacker gains control
// Attacker calls: setSwapReferrer(ATTACKER_ADDRESS)
// All future swap referrer fees go to attacker
```

#### Real-World Parallels
- Router contract upgrades gone wrong
- Private key leaks from development teams
- Governance attacks on router DAOs
- Supply chain attacks on router dependencies

### 2. **Router with Lost Access to Referrer Wallet**

#### Attack Description
A router where the referrer wallet becomes permanently inaccessible:
- **Lost private keys** - Referrer wallet keys permanently lost
- **Forgotten seed phrases** - Cannot recover referrer wallet access
- **Hardware wallet failure** - Physical device damage, loss, or malfunction
- **Custody service failure** - Third-party custodian loses access or goes bankrupt
- **Death or incapacitation** of key holder without proper succession planning

#### Attack Impact
- Swap referrer fees sent to inaccessible address
- Fees permanently locked and lost to the ecosystem
- No way to recover or redirect fees
- Economic loss for intended beneficiaries
- Reduced incentives for ecosystem participants

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Router continues sending fees to lost wallet
contract RouterWithLostWallet {
    address public swapReferrer = 0x...LostWalletAddress;
    
    function swap(...) external {
        // Fees continue to be sent to inaccessible address
        // No one can ever access these fees again
        IUniswapV3Pool(pool).swap(..., swapReferrer, ...);
    }
}
```

#### Economic Impact
- Estimated loss: Could be millions in fees over time
- Affects ecosystem growth and participation
- Creates dead capital in the system
- May discourage router development

### 3. **Fake Router with Referrer Fee Siphoning**

#### Attack Description
A malicious router designed to look legitimate but secretly steal referrer fees:
- **Frontend manipulation** - Appears legitimate to users through fake UI
- **Referrer address hijacking** - Silently changes referrer to attacker
- **Fee rate manipulation** - Claims higher referrer fees than configured
- **Selective targeting** - Only attacks high-value transactions to avoid detection
- **Social engineering** - Convinces users to use malicious router

#### Attack Impact
- Steals referrer fees from legitimate transactions
- Difficult to detect without constant monitoring
- Affects user trust in the entire ecosystem
- May bypass detection systems through sophisticated design
- Creates unfair competition with legitimate routers

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Malicious router that hijacks referrer fees
contract FakeRouter {
    address constant ATTACKER_ADDRESS = 0x...AttackerWallet;
    
    function exactInputSingle(ExactInputSingleParams calldata params) external {
        // User thinks they're using legitimate referrer
        // But router silently replaces with attacker's address
        
        IUniswapV3Pool(pool).swap(
            params.recipient,
            params.zeroForOne,
            params.amountIn,
            params.sqrtPriceLimitX96,
            ATTACKER_ADDRESS,  // Hijacked referrer address
            data
        );
        
        // User sees successful swap but referrer fees were stolen
    }
}
```

#### Detection Challenges
- Transactions appear normal on-chain
- Users may not realize referrer fees were stolen
- Requires detailed transaction analysis to detect
- May use sophisticated obfuscation techniques

### 4. **Router with Backdoor Access**

#### Attack Description
A router that appears legitimate but contains hidden backdoors for malicious access:
- **Hidden admin functions** - Secret functions for changing referrer addresses
- **Time-based backdoors** - Activate after certain block number or timestamp
- **Conditional backdoors** - Only trigger under specific conditions
- **Obfuscated code** - Complex logic that hides malicious behavior
- **Upgradeable backdoors** - Hidden in implementation contracts

#### Attack Impact
- Delayed attacks that are extremely hard to detect
- Insider threats from router developers
- Systematic fee theft over extended periods
- Difficult to trace and prevent
- May affect multiple users simultaneously

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Router with hidden backdoor
contract BackdoorRouter {
    address public swapReferrer;
    address private hiddenAdmin = 0x...AttackerAddress;
    uint256 private activationBlock = 18000000; // Future block
    
    function swap(...) external {
        address effectiveReferrer = swapReferrer;
        
        // Hidden backdoor that activates later
        if (block.number > activationBlock && tx.origin == hiddenAdmin) {
            effectiveReferrer = hiddenAdmin;
        }
        
        IUniswapV3Pool(pool).swap(..., effectiveReferrer, ...);
    }
    
    // Hidden function that only attacker knows about
    function emergencyUpdate(uint256 _key, address _newReferrer) external {
        if (_key == 0x123456789abcdef && msg.sender == hiddenAdmin) {
            swapReferrer = _newReferrer;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sophisticated Variants
- Code that looks legitimate but has subtle vulnerabilities
- Backdoors hidden in library dependencies
- Time-delayed activation mechanisms
- Conditional logic based on external contract states

### 5. **Router with Referrer Fee Inflation**

#### Attack Description
A router that manipulates referrer fee rates to steal more fees than authorized:
- **Fee rate manipulation** - Claims higher fees than pool configuration allows
- **Multiple referrer claims** - Sends fees to multiple attacker addresses
- **Fee calculation errors** - "Accidentally" overcalculates referrer fees
- **Sandwich attack integration** - Combines with MEV for maximum extraction
- **Dynamic fee manipulation** - Changes rates based on transaction size

#### Attack Impact
- Reduces liquidity provider rewards systematically
- Increases overall swap costs for users
- Systematic value extraction from the protocol
- May destabilize pool economics over time
- Creates unfair advantage for malicious actors

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Router that inflates referrer fees
contract InflationRouter {
    function calculateReferrerFee(uint256 totalFee) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // Pool configured for 5% referrer fee (1/20)
        // But router claims 20% (1/5) - 4x inflation
        return totalFee / 5;  // Should be totalFee / 20
    }
    
    function swap(...) external {
        // Normal swap execution
        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).swap(...);
        
        // Inflated referrer fee calculation
        uint256 inflatedReferrerFee = calculateReferrerFee(swapFee);
        
        // Attacker receives 4x the intended referrer fee
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, attacker, inflatedReferrerFee);
    }
}
```

#### Economic Damage
- Systematic theft from liquidity providers
- Reduced pool efficiency and competitiveness
- May drive away legitimate liquidity providers
- Creates long-term damage to protocol economics

### 6. **Router with Selective Scamming**

#### Attack Description
A router that selectively scams based on transaction characteristics to avoid detection:
- **Value-based targeting** - Only attacks high-value transactions
- **User-based targeting** - Targets specific user addresses or types
- **Time-based attacks** - Only active during specific periods
- **Probabilistic scamming** - Randomly selects victims to avoid patterns
- **Geographic targeting** - Targets users from specific regions

#### Attack Impact
- Extremely difficult to detect due to selective nature
- Affects user trust unpredictably
- May avoid automated monitoring systems
- Long-term reputation damage when discovered
- Creates uncertainty in the ecosystem

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Router that selectively scams large transactions
contract SelectiveScamRouter {
    address constant ATTACKER_ADDRESS = 0x...AttackerWallet;
    uint256 constant SCAM_THRESHOLD = 10000 * 1e18; // 10,000 tokens
    
    function swap(...) external {
        address effectiveReferrer = legitimateReferrer;
        
        // Only attack large transactions to avoid detection
        if (amountIn > SCAM_THRESHOLD) {
            effectiveReferrer = ATTACKER_ADDRESS;
        }
        
        // Small transactions work normally, large ones get scammed
        IUniswapV3Pool(pool).swap(..., effectiveReferrer, ...);
    }
    
    // Alternative: Random probability scamming
    function randomScam() internal view returns (bool) {
        // 1% chance of scamming any transaction
        return uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % 100 == 0;
    }
}
```

#### Detection Challenges
- Appears legitimate most of the time
- Statistical analysis required to detect patterns
- May take months or years to discover
- Sophisticated variants use multiple selection criteria

### 7. **Router with Referrer Fee Laundering**

#### Attack Description
A router that uses complex schemes to hide the destination of referrer fees:
- **Multi-hop fee transfers** - Routes fees through multiple addresses
- **Mixer integration** - Uses privacy protocols to hide fee destination
- **Cross-chain laundering** - Bridges fees to other blockchains
- **DeFi integration** - Deposits fees into complex DeFi protocols
- **Automated laundering** - Uses smart contracts to obscure fee trails

#### Attack Impact
- Makes it extremely difficult to trace stolen fees
- Enables large-scale fee theft operations
- Complicates legal and regulatory compliance
- May involve criminal money laundering
- Creates significant forensic challenges

#### Example Scenario
```solidity
// Router with fee laundering mechanism
contract LaunderingRouter {
    address[] private mixerAddresses;
    address private finalDestination;
    
    function swap(...) external {
        // Execute normal swap
        IUniswapV3Pool(pool).swap(...);
        
        // Launder referrer fees through multiple hops
        launderFees(referrerFeeAmount);
    }
    
    function launderFees(uint256 amount) private {
        // Route through multiple mixer addresses
        for (uint i = 0; i < mixerAddresses.length; i++) {
            // Complex laundering logic
            // Fees eventually reach attacker but trail is obscured
        }
    }
}
```

#### Regulatory Implications
- May violate anti-money laundering regulations
- Creates compliance challenges for protocol operators
- May attract regulatory scrutiny
- Complicates law enforcement investigations

- Maintains ecosystem quality control

#### Code Example
```solidity
// Pool checks router whitelist before processing referrer fees
function swap(..., address swapReferrer, ...) external {
    // Only process referrer fees if router is whitelisted
    address effectiveReferrer = IUniswapV3Factory(factory).whitelistedRouters(msg.sender) 
        ? swapReferrer 
        : address(0);
    
    // Continue with swap using effective referrer
}
```

### 2. **Monitoring and Detection Systems**

#### On-Chain Monitoring
- Track referrer fee distributions in real-time
- Monitor for unusual fee patterns or destinations

#### Example Monitoring Alerts
```solidity
// Example monitoring contract
contract RouterMonitor {
    mapping(address => uint256) public referrerFeesSent;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastActivityTime;
    
    function trackReferrerFee(address router, address referrer, uint256 amount) external {
        referrerFeesSent[router] += amount;
        
        // Alert if sudden spike in fees
        if (amount > previousAverage * 10) {
            emit SuspiciousActivity(router, referrer, amount);
        }
