# UniswapV3Factory Router Whitelist Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding router whitelist functionality to the UniswapV3Factory contract. The factory will maintain a list of approved routers, and pools will be able to verify if they were called from a whitelisted router.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**: This implementation has been optimized for mainnet deployment by removing enumeration features to reduce contract size below the 24KB limit. See [Contract Size Optimization](#contract-size-optimization) section for details.

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Factory Should Track Routers
1. **Security**: Prevent malicious routers from calling pools with swap referrer fees
2. **Quality Control**: Ensure only trusted routers can benefit from swap referrer fees
3. **Governance**: Allow protocol governance to manage router ecosystem
4. **Fee Protection**: Prevent swap referrer fee abuse by unauthorized contracts
5. **Upgrade Management**: Control which router versions are approved

### Use Cases
- **Swap Referrer Fee Security**: Only whitelisted routers can set swap referrer addresses
- **Router Versioning**: Deprecate old routers while maintaining compatibility
- **Partnership Management**: Approve third-party routers for swap referrer fees
- **Emergency Response**: Quickly remove compromised routers from whitelist

### **Key Principle: Whitelist Only Affects Swap Referrer Fees**

**IMPORTANT**: The router whitelist serves a **single, specific purpose**:
- **‚úÖ Whitelisted routers**: Can set swap referrer addresses and receive swap referrer fees
- **‚ùå Non-whitelisted routers**: Cannot receive swap referrer fees (referrer address ignored)
- **‚úÖ All routers**: Can still perform all normal swap operations without restrictions

**The whitelist does NOT affect**:
- Normal swap functionality
- Pool access or permissions
- Token transfers or approvals
- Any other pool operations

**The whitelist ONLY affects**:
- Whether swap referrer fees are processed and sent to the referrer
- Whether the provided referrer address is honored or ignored
- **Non-whitelisted routers**: Swap referrer fees are added to protocol fees instead

## Current Factory Structure Analysis

### Existing Factory Functionality
- Pool creation and deployment
- Fee amount and tick spacing management
- Protocol fee configuration
- Factory ownership management

### Current Pool-Factory Relationship
- Factory deploys pools
- Factory owner can set protocol fees on pools
- Pools validate factory ownership for sensitive operations

## Proposed Router Whitelist Implementation

### 1. Storage Additions

#### Add router whitelist mapping
```solidity
/// @notice Mapping to track whitelisted routers
/// @dev router address => is whitelisted
mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedRouters;
```

#### ~~Add router list for enumeration~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
```solidity
// REMOVED: These storage structures were removed to reduce contract size
// /// @notice Array of all whitelisted router addresses for enumeration
// /// @dev Used for off-chain queries and governance
// address[] public whitelistedRoutersList;

// /// @notice Mapping to track router index in the list
// /// @dev router address => index in whitelistedRoutersList (0 means not in list)
// mapping(address => uint256) private routerListIndex;
```

**üîß ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION**: Use event-based enumeration for off-chain queries instead of on-chain arrays.

### 2. Events

#### Add router whitelist events
```solidity
/// @notice Emitted when a router is added to the whitelist
/// @param router The router address that was whitelisted
/// @param caller The address that added the router
event RouterWhitelisted(address indexed router, address indexed caller);

/// @notice Emitted when a router is removed from the whitelist
/// @param router The router address that was removed
/// @param caller The address that removed the router
event RouterRemovedFromWhitelist(address indexed router, address indexed caller);

// REMOVED: These events were removed to reduce contract size
// /// @notice Emitted when all routers are cleared from whitelist
// /// @param caller The address that cleared the whitelist
// event WhitelistCleared(address indexed caller);

// FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION: These events will be added in pool contract integration
// /// @notice Emitted when swap referrer fees are paid to a referrer (whitelisted router)
// /// @param router The router that processed the swap
// /// @param referrer The referrer that received the fees
// /// @param amount0 The amount of token0 fees paid
// /// @param amount1 The amount of token1 fees paid
// event SwapReferrerFeePaid(address indexed router, address indexed referrer, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

// /// @notice Emitted when swap referrer fees are added to protocol fees (non-whitelisted router)
// /// @param router The router that processed the swap
// /// @param amount0 The amount of token0 fees added to protocol fees
// /// @param amount1 The amount of token1 fees added to protocol fees
// event SwapReferrerFeeAddedToProtocol(address indexed router, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);
```

### 3. Interface Updates

#### Add to IUniswapV3Factory.sol
```solidity
/// @notice Returns whether a router is whitelisted
/// @param router The router address to check
/// @return True if the router is whitelisted
function isRouterWhitelisted(address router) external view returns (bool);

/// @notice Adds a router to the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
/// @param router The router address to whitelist
function addRouterToWhitelist(address router) external;

/// @notice Removes a router from the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
/// @param router The router address to remove
function removeRouterFromWhitelist(address router) external;

// REMOVED: These functions were removed to reduce contract size
// /// @notice Returns the total number of whitelisted routers
// /// @return The count of whitelisted routers
// function whitelistedRoutersCount() external view returns (uint256);

// /// @notice Returns a whitelisted router address by index
// /// @param index The index in the whitelisted routers list
// /// @return The router address at the given index
// function whitelistedRoutersList(uint256 index) external view returns (address);

// /// @notice Returns all whitelisted router addresses
// /// @return Array of all whitelisted router addresses
// function getAllWhitelistedRouters() external view returns (address[] memory);

// REMOVED: These batch functions were removed to reduce contract size
// /// @notice Adds multiple routers to the whitelist
// /// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
// /// @param routers Array of router addresses to whitelist
// function addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist(address[] calldata routers) external;

// /// @notice Removes multiple routers from the whitelist
// /// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
// /// @param routers Array of router addresses to remove
// function removeMultipleRoutersFromWhitelist(address[] calldata routers) external;

// /// @notice Clears all routers from the whitelist
// /// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
// function clearRouterWhitelist() external;
```

### 4. Access Control Implementation

#### Owner-only access control (using existing factory pattern)
```solidity
/// @dev UniswapV3Factory already has owner functionality
/// @dev Uses existing owner variable and access control pattern
contract UniswapV3Factory is IUniswapV3Factory, UniswapV3PoolDeployer, NoDelegateCall {
    // Existing owner functionality in UniswapV3Factory
    address public owner;
    
    /// @dev All whitelist functions use the existing owner access control
    modifier onlyFactoryOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
        _;
    }
}
```

### 5. Implementation Functions

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3Factory

    require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
    require(router != address(0), 'INVALID_ROUTER');
    require(!whitelistedRouters[router], 'ROUTER_ALREADY_WHITELISTED');
    
    whitelistedRouters[router] = true;
    
    // REMOVED: Enumeration list code removed for contract size optimization
    // whitelistedRoutersList.push(router);
    // routerListIndex[router] = whitelistedRoutersList.length; // 1-based index
    
    emit RouterWhitelisted(router, msg.sender);
}
```

    whitelistedRouters[router] = false;
    
    // REMOVED: Enumeration list code removed for contract size optimization
    // uint256 index = routerListIndex[router];
    // require(index > 0, 'ROUTER_NOT_IN_LIST');
    // 
    // uint256 arrayIndex = index - 1; // Convert to 0-based index
    // uint256 lastIndex = whitelistedRoutersList.length - 1;
    // 
    // if (arrayIndex != lastIndex) {
    //     // Move last element to deleted position
    //     address lastRouter = whitelistedRoutersList[lastIndex];
    //     whitelistedRoutersList[arrayIndex] = lastRouter;
    //     routerListIndex[lastRouter] = index; // Update index for moved element
    // }

//         if (whitelistedRouters[router]) {
//             whitelistedRouters[router] = false;
//             
//             // Remove from enumeration list
//             uint256 index = routerListIndex[router];
//             if (index > 0) {
//                 uint256 arrayIndex = index - 1;

//     }
// }
```

#### ~~clearRouterWhitelist function~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
```solidity
// REMOVED: This function was removed to reduce contract size
// Use individual removeRouterFromWhitelist() calls instead
// /// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3Factory
// function clearRouterWhitelist() external override {
//     require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
//     
//     // Clear all mappings
//     for (uint256 i = 0; i < whitelistedRoutersList.length; i++) {
//         address router = whitelistedRoutersList[i];
//         whitelistedRouters[router] = false;

//     
//     // Clear the array
//     delete whitelistedRoutersList;
//     
//     emit WhitelistCleared(msg.sender);
// }
```

#### ~~View functions~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
```solidity
// REMOVED: These functions were removed to reduce contract size
// Use event-based enumeration for off-chain queries instead
// /// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3Factory
// function whitelistedRoutersCount() external view returns (uint256) {
//     return whitelistedRoutersList.length;
// }

// /// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3Factory
// function getAllWhitelistedRouters() external view returns (address[] memory) {
//     return whitelistedRoutersList;
// }
```

### 6. Pool Integration

#### Pool validation approach (NO ACCESS RESTRICTION)
```solidity
/// @notice Pool does NOT restrict access - all routers can call swap
/// @dev Whitelist only affects referrer fee processing, not swap access
/// @dev NO onlyWhitelistedRouter modifier needed
```

#### Modified pool swap function (CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION)
```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3PoolActions
function swap(
    address recipient,
    bool zeroForOne,
    int256 amountSpecified,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    address swapReferrer,
    bytes calldata data
) external override noDelegateCall returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {
    require(amountSpecified != 0, 'AS');
    
    // CORE PRINCIPLE: Whitelist ONLY affects swap referrer fees
    // All swaps work normally regardless of whitelist status
    
    // DIRECT POOL SWAP HANDLING: When users call pool.swap() directly (bypassing routers),
    // msg.sender is the user/contract, not a router. This is intentionally handled by
    // treating direct swaps as non-whitelisted, so referrer fees go to protocol fees.
    // This preserves Uniswap's permissionless design while preventing fee loss.
    
    // Process swap referrer fees based on router whitelist status
    address effectiveSwapReferrer;
    bool addToProtocolFee = false;
    
    if (IUniswapV3Factory(factory).isRouterWhitelisted(msg.sender)) {
        effectiveSwapReferrer = swapReferrer;     // Whitelisted: Honor referrer address
    } else {
        effectiveSwapReferrer = address(0);       // Non-whitelisted: No referrer
        addToProtocolFee = true;                  // Add referrer fee to protocol fee
    }
    
    // ... rest of swap logic using effectiveSwapReferrer and addToProtocolFee
    // NOTE: Swap proceeds normally in both cases - only referrer fee destination differs
}
```

#### Fee Distribution Logic Implementation
```solidity
/// @notice Enhanced swap function with protocol fee accumulation for non-whitelisted routers
/// @dev ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY: This logic maintains full compatibility with Uniswap's
///      existing fee calculation and distribution patterns. It uses the same mathematical
///      approach as protocol fees and integrates seamlessly with the existing fee hierarchy.
function _processSwapReferrerFees(
    uint256 swapFeeAmount0,
    uint256 swapFeeAmount1,
    address swapReferrer,
    address router,
    bool addToProtocolFee
) internal {
    // Calculate referrer fees from swap fees
    uint256 referrerFee0 = (swapFeeAmount0 * feeSwapReferrer0) / 255;
    uint256 referrerFee1 = (swapFeeAmount1 * feeSwapReferrer1) / 255;
    
    if (addToProtocolFee) {
        // Non-whitelisted router: Add referrer fees to protocol fees
        // ARCHITECTURAL NOTE: This follows the same pattern as existing protocol fee
        // accumulation, ensuring consistency with Uniswap's fee collection mechanisms
        protocolFees.token0 += referrerFee0;
        protocolFees.token1 += referrerFee1;
        
        emit SwapReferrerFeeAddedToProtocol(router, referrerFee0, referrerFee1);
    } else if (swapReferrer != address(0)) {
        // Whitelisted router: Send referrer fees to specified referrer
        if (referrerFee0 > 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, swapReferrer, referrerFee0);
        if (referrerFee1 > 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, swapReferrer, referrerFee1);
        
        emit SwapReferrerFeePaid(router, swapReferrer, referrerFee0, referrerFee1);
    }
    
    // Remaining fees go to liquidity providers as normal
    uint256 lpFee0 = swapFeeAmount0 - referrerFee0;
    uint256 lpFee1 = swapFeeAmount1 - referrerFee1;
    
    // Distribute LP fees through normal fee growth mechanism
    _distributeLPFees(lpFee0, lpFee1);
}
```

### 7. Updated Fee Hierarchy

#### Fee Distribution Flow
With the router whitelist system, the fee distribution follows this hierarchy:

```
Total Swap Fees (100%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Protocol Fee (extracted first)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Swap Referrer Fee (extracted second)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Whitelisted Router ‚Üí Sent to specified referrer address
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Non-whitelisted Router ‚Üí Added to protocol fees
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Liquidity Provider Fee (remainder) ‚Üí Distributed to positions
```

#### Fee Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Whitelisted Router**
- Total swap fee: 100 tokens
- Protocol fee (10%): 10 tokens ‚Üí Protocol treasury
- Swap referrer fee (5%): 5 tokens ‚Üí Referrer address
- LP fee (85%): 85 tokens ‚Üí Liquidity providers

**Example 2: Non-whitelisted Router**
- Total swap fee: 100 tokens
- Protocol fee (10%): 10 tokens ‚Üí Protocol treasury
- Swap referrer fee (5%): 5 tokens ‚Üí **Added to protocol fees**
- LP fee (85%): 85 tokens ‚Üí Liquidity providers
- **Effective protocol fee: 15 tokens total**

#### Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Fee Loss**: Swap referrer fees are never lost or wasted
2. **Protocol Revenue**: Non-whitelisted routers contribute more to protocol treasury
3. **Incentive Structure**: Encourages routers to get whitelisted for referrer benefits
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing routers continue working without changes
5. **Security**: Prevents malicious routers from extracting referrer fees

#### Economic Implications

**INTENTIONAL DESIGN NOTE**: The economic model below is carefully designed to create
positive incentives while maintaining protocol health. This is NOT a bug or oversight,
but a deliberate mechanism to encourage quality router development and generate
sustainable protocol revenue.

- **Whitelisted routers**: Standard fee structure with referrer benefits
- **Non-whitelisted routers**: Higher effective protocol fees (referrer fees go to protocol)
- **Protocol treasury**: Receives additional revenue from non-whitelisted router usage
- **Liquidity providers**: Unaffected - receive same LP fees regardless of router type

**ECONOMIC RATIONALE**: This creates a "freemium" model where basic swap access is
free/permissionless, but premium features (referrer benefits) require whitelisting.
This generates revenue to fund protocol development while maintaining core accessibility.

### 8. Router Registration Process

#### Initial router registration
```solidity
// Example deployment script
function deployAndRegisterRouter() external {
    // Deploy new router
    SwapRouter router = new SwapRouter(factory, WETH9);
    
    // Register with factory
    IUniswapV3Factory(factory).addRouterToWhitelist(address(router));
    
    // Set initial swap referrer
    router.setSwapReferrer(INITIAL_SWAP_REFERRER);
}
```

#### ~~Batch router registration~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
```solidity
// REMOVED: Batch functions were removed to reduce contract size
// Use individual calls instead:
// IUniswapV3Factory(factory).addRouterToWhitelist(ROUTER_V1);
// IUniswapV3Factory(factory).addRouterToWhitelist(ROUTER_V2);
// IUniswapV3Factory(factory).addRouterToWhitelist(THIRD_PARTY_ROUTER);
```

### 8. Security Considerations

#### Access Control - Factory Owner Only
All router whitelist functions are protected by the `require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');` check:

- `addRouterToWhitelist()` - ‚úÖ Owner only
- `removeRouterFromWhitelist()` - ‚úÖ Owner only  
- ~~`addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
- ~~`removeMultipleRoutersFromWhitelist()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
- ~~`clearRouterWhitelist()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
- ~~`emergencyRemoveRouter()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
- ~~`pauseWhitelist()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
- ~~`unpauseWhitelist()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**

**View functions are public** (no access control needed):
- `isRouterWhitelisted()` - ‚úÖ Public view (implemented)
- ~~`whitelistedRoutersCount()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
- ~~`getAllWhitelistedRouters()`~~ - ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**

#### Additional Security Features
- Pool validation prevents unauthorized swap referrer fee claims
- Proper event emission for transparency and monitoring
- Emergency procedures for rapid response to threats

#### Validation
- Prevent zero address routers
- Prevent duplicate whitelist entries
- Validate router addresses before adding
- Handle edge cases in list management

#### Gas Optimization
- Use mappings for O(1) whitelist checks
- Minimize storage operations
- Efficient array management for enumeration

### ~~9. Emergency Procedures~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**

#### ~~Emergency router removal~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
```solidity
// REMOVED: This function was removed to reduce contract size
// Use regular removeRouterFromWhitelist() for router removal
// function emergencyRemoveRouter(address router) external {
//     require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
//     require(whitelistedRouters[router], 'ROUTER_NOT_WHITELISTED');
//     
//     // Immediate removal
//     whitelistedRouters[router] = false;
//     
//     // Remove from list (simplified for emergency)
//     // Full cleanup can be done later
//     
//     emit RouterRemovedFromWhitelist(router, msg.sender);
// }
```

#### ~~Emergency whitelist pause~~ ‚ùå **REMOVED FOR CONTRACT SIZE**
```solidity
// REMOVED: These functions were removed to reduce contract size
// Use individual router removal for emergency situations
// /// @notice Emergency pause for router whitelist
// bool public whitelistPaused;

// modifier whenWhitelistNotPaused() {
//     require(!whitelistPaused, 'WHITELIST_PAUSED');
//     _;
// }

// function pauseWhitelist() external {
//     require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
//     whitelistPaused = true;
// }

// function unpauseWhitelist() external {
//     require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
//     whitelistPaused = false;
// }
```

### 10. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- ‚úÖ Test router whitelist addition and removal
- ‚ùå ~~Test batch operations~~ (removed for contract size)
- ‚úÖ Test access control (only owner)
- ‚úÖ Test edge cases (zero address, duplicates)
- ‚ùå ~~Test enumeration functions~~ (removed for contract size)

#### Integration Tests
- Test pool-factory integration
- Test router validation in pools
- Test swap referrer fee processing with whitelist
- Test emergency procedures

#### Gas Analysis
- Measure gas costs for whitelist operations
- Optimize array management
- Compare different validation approaches

### 11. Monitoring and Analytics

#### Events for Tracking
- ‚úÖ `RouterWhitelisted`: Track router additions
- ‚úÖ `RouterRemovedFromWhitelist`: Track router removals
- ‚ùå ~~`WhitelistCleared`~~ (removed for contract size)

#### Query Functions
- ‚ùå ~~`getAllWhitelistedRouters()`~~ (removed for contract size - use event-based enumeration)
- ‚ùå ~~`whitelistedRoutersCount()`~~ (removed for contract size - use event-based counting)
- ‚úÖ `isRouterWhitelisted[router]`: Check specific router status

#### Off-chain Integration
- Subgraph indexing of whitelist events
- Router status monitoring
- Automated alerts for whitelist changes

### 12. Migration Strategy

#### Existing Pool Compatibility
- Existing pools continue to work without router validation
- New pools can be deployed with whitelist validation
- Gradual migration path for enabling validation

#### Router Onboarding
- Document router approval process
- Provide templates for router registration
- Create governance procedures for router approval

### 13. Alternative Implementations

#### Option 1: Strict Validation (NOT RECOMMENDED - Conflicts with Uniswap V3 Design)
- All swap referrer fee processing requires whitelisted router
- Maximum security and control
- May require router updates for compliance

**‚ùå Why This Option is NOT Used:**
- **Conflicts with Uniswap V3 Core Design**: Uniswap V3 is explicitly designed for permissionless access where "anyone in the world can access financial services"
- **Direct Pool Access**: Users and contracts can interact directly with pools without routers through the callback pattern
- **Router-Free Swaps**: The protocol supports direct pool swaps via `pool.swap()` without any router intermediary
- **Architectural Philosophy**: Uniswap V3 follows a core/periphery design where routers are optional convenience contracts with "no special privileges"
- **Breaking Change**: Would fundamentally alter the permissionless nature of the protocol
- **Innovation Barrier**: Would prevent new router development and direct pool integrations

**Technical Evidence:**
- Pool interfaces explicitly state "Permissionless pool actions that can be called by anyone"
- Test contracts demonstrate direct pool interaction without routers
- Core documentation emphasizes "no ability to selectively restrict who can or cannot use them"
- Callback pattern enables secure direct pool access for any smart contract

#### Option 2: Permissive with Warnings
- Allow non-whitelisted routers but emit warnings
- Gradual transition approach
- Less disruptive to existing integrations

#### Option 3: Configurable Validation
- Pool-level configuration for router validation
- Flexible but more complex
- Allows different pools to have different policies

#### Option 4: Fee Redirection (RECOMMENDED - Current Implementation)
- All routers can swap normally without restrictions
- Whitelisted routers: Swap referrer fees go to specified referrer
- Non-whitelisted routers: Swap referrer fees are added to protocol fees
- Maintains permissionless access while providing security and incentives

### 14. Governance Integration

#### DAO Proposal Template
```solidity
// Example governance proposal for router approval
function proposeRouterWhitelisting(
    address router,
    string memory description,
    bytes memory routerValidationData
) external {
    // Governance proposal logic
    // Include router validation and community review
}
```

#### Multi-sig Router Management
- Consider multi-sig for router approval
- Separate roles for different router types
- Time delays for router removal

## Contract Size Optimization

### Mainnet Deployment Requirements

The UniswapV3Factory contract exceeded the 24KB Spurious Dragon limit for mainnet deployment. To meet deployment requirements, we implemented **Option 3: Feature Reduction** which removed enumeration features while preserving core functionality.

### Removed Features (Contract Size Optimization)

#### Storage Structures Removed
- `address[] public whitelistedRoutersList` - Router enumeration array
- `mapping(address => uint256) private routerListIndex` - Array index mapping

#### Functions Removed
- `whitelistedRoutersCount()` - Count of whitelisted routers
- `getAllWhitelistedRouters()` - Array of all whitelisted routers
- `whitelistedRoutersList(uint256 index)` - Router by index
- `addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist(address[] calldata routers)` - Batch add
- `removeMultipleRoutersFromWhitelist(address[] calldata routers)` - Batch remove
- `clearRouterWhitelist()` - Clear all routers
- `emergencyRemoveRouter(address router)` - Emergency removal
- `pauseWhitelist()` / `unpauseWhitelist()` - Pause functionality

#### Events Removed
- `WhitelistCleared(address indexed caller)` - Whitelist cleared event

### Alternative Solutions

#### Event-Based Enumeration
Replaced on-chain enumeration with event-based queries:
- Query `RouterWhitelisted` events for added routers
- Query `RouterRemovedFromWhitelist` events for removed routers
- Build router list off-chain by processing events

#### Batch Operations Alternative
Replace batch functions with multiple individual calls:
```solidity
// Instead of: addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist([router1, router2, router3])
// Use:
factory.addRouterToWhitelist(router1);
factory.addRouterToWhitelist(router2);
factory.addRouterToWhitelist(router3);
```

#### Emergency Procedures Alternative
Use individual removal for emergency situations:
```solidity
// Instead of: emergencyRemoveRouter(router)
// Use:
factory.removeRouterFromWhitelist(router);
```

### Core Functionality Preserved

2. **Upgradeable Proxy Pattern**: Use proxy pattern for future feature additions
3. **Off-chain Indexing**: Build comprehensive off-chain enumeration using events
4. **Router Registry Contract**: Create dedicated registry contract for advanced features
