# UniswapV3Factory Router Whitelist Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding router whitelist functionality to the UniswapV3Factory contract. The factory will maintain a list of approved routers, and pools will be able to verify if they were called from a whitelisted router.

## Purpose and Benefits

### Why Factory Should Track Routers
1. **Security**: Prevent malicious routers from calling pools with swap referrer fees
2. **Quality Control**: Ensure only trusted routers can benefit from swap referrer fees
3. **Governance**: Allow protocol governance to manage router ecosystem
4. **Fee Protection**: Prevent swap referrer fee abuse by unauthorized contracts
5. **Upgrade Management**: Control which router versions are approved

### Use Cases
- **Swap Referrer Fee Security**: Only whitelisted routers can set swap referrer addresses
- **Router Versioning**: Deprecate old routers while maintaining compatibility
- **Partnership Management**: Approve third-party routers for swap referrer fees
- **Emergency Response**: Quickly remove compromised routers from whitelist

### **Key Principle: Whitelist Only Affects Swap Referrer Fees**

**IMPORTANT**: The router whitelist serves a **single, specific purpose**:
- **✅ Whitelisted routers**: Can set swap referrer addresses and receive swap referrer fees
- **❌ Non-whitelisted routers**: Cannot receive swap referrer fees (referrer address ignored)
- **✅ All routers**: Can still perform all normal swap operations without restrictions

**The whitelist does NOT affect**:
- Normal swap functionality
- Pool access or permissions
- Token transfers or approvals
- Any other pool operations

**The whitelist ONLY affects**:
- Whether swap referrer fees are processed and sent to the referrer
- Whether the provided referrer address is honored or ignored
- **Non-whitelisted routers**: Swap referrer fees are added to protocol fees instead

## Current Factory Structure Analysis

### Existing Factory Functionality
- Pool creation and deployment
- Fee amount and tick spacing management
- Protocol fee configuration
- Factory ownership management

### Current Pool-Factory Relationship
- Factory deploys pools
- Factory owner can set protocol fees on pools
- Pools validate factory ownership for sensitive operations

## Proposed Router Whitelist Implementation

### 1. Storage Additions

#### Add router whitelist mapping
```solidity
/// @notice Mapping to track whitelisted routers
/// @dev router address => is whitelisted
mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedRouters;
```

#### Add router list for enumeration (optional)
```solidity
/// @notice Array of all whitelisted router addresses for enumeration
/// @dev Used for off-chain queries and governance
address[] public whitelistedRoutersList;

/// @notice Mapping to track router index in the list
/// @dev router address => index in whitelistedRoutersList (0 means not in list)
mapping(address => uint256) private routerListIndex;
```

### 2. Events

#### Add router whitelist events
```solidity
/// @notice Emitted when a router is added to the whitelist
/// @param router The router address that was whitelisted
/// @param caller The address that added the router
event RouterWhitelisted(address indexed router, address indexed caller);

/// @notice Emitted when a router is removed from the whitelist
/// @param router The router address that was removed
/// @param caller The address that removed the router
event RouterRemovedFromWhitelist(address indexed router, address indexed caller);

/// @notice Emitted when all routers are cleared from whitelist
/// @param caller The address that cleared the whitelist
event WhitelistCleared(address indexed caller);

/// @notice Emitted when swap referrer fees are paid to a referrer (whitelisted router)
/// @param router The router that processed the swap
/// @param referrer The referrer that received the fees
/// @param amount0 The amount of token0 fees paid
/// @param amount1 The amount of token1 fees paid
event SwapReferrerFeePaid(address indexed router, address indexed referrer, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);

/// @notice Emitted when swap referrer fees are added to protocol fees (non-whitelisted router)
/// @param router The router that processed the swap
/// @param amount0 The amount of token0 fees added to protocol fees
/// @param amount1 The amount of token1 fees added to protocol fees
event SwapReferrerFeeAddedToProtocol(address indexed router, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1);
```

### 3. Interface Updates

#### Add to IUniswapV3Factory.sol
```solidity
/// @notice Returns whether a router is whitelisted
/// @param router The router address to check
/// @return True if the router is whitelisted
/// @dev NAMING NOTE: Function name is isRouterWhitelisted() to avoid conflict with 
///      the whitelistedRouters mapping. This prevents compilation errors.
function isRouterWhitelisted(address router) external view returns (bool);

/// @notice Returns the total number of whitelisted routers
/// @return The count of whitelisted routers
function whitelistedRoutersCount() external view returns (uint256);

/// @notice Returns a whitelisted router address by index
/// @param index The index in the whitelisted routers list
/// @return The router address at the given index
function whitelistedRoutersList(uint256 index) external view returns (address);

/// @notice Returns all whitelisted router addresses
/// @return Array of all whitelisted router addresses
function getAllWhitelistedRouters() external view returns (address[] memory);

/// @notice Adds a router to the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
/// @param router The router address to whitelist
function addRouterToWhitelist(address router) external;

/// @notice Removes a router from the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
/// @param router The router address to remove
function removeRouterFromWhitelist(address router) external;

/// @notice Adds multiple routers to the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
/// @param routers Array of router addresses to whitelist
function addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist(address[] calldata routers) external;

/// @notice Removes multiple routers from the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
/// @param routers Array of router addresses to remove
function removeMultipleRoutersFromWhitelist(address[] calldata routers) external;

/// @notice Clears all routers from the whitelist
/// @dev Can only be called by the factory owner
function clearRouterWhitelist() external;
```

### 4. Access Control Implementation

#### Owner-only access control (using existing factory pattern)
```solidity
/// @dev UniswapV3Factory already has owner functionality
/// @dev Uses existing owner variable and access control pattern
contract UniswapV3Factory is IUniswapV3Factory, UniswapV3PoolDeployer, NoDelegateCall {
    // Existing owner functionality in UniswapV3Factory
    address public owner;
    
    /// @dev All whitelist functions use the existing owner access control
    modifier onlyFactoryOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
        _;
    }
}
```

    uint256 lastIndex = whitelistedRoutersList.length - 1;
    
    if (arrayIndex != lastIndex) {
        // Move last element to deleted position

                uint256 lastIndex = whitelistedRoutersList.length - 1;
                
                if (arrayIndex != lastIndex) {
                    address lastRouter = whitelistedRoutersList[lastIndex];
                    whitelistedRoutersList[arrayIndex] = lastRouter;
                    routerListIndex[lastRouter] = index;
                }

    return whitelistedRoutersList.length;
}

/// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3Factory
function getAllWhitelistedRouters() external view override returns (address[] memory) {
    return whitelistedRoutersList;
}
```

### 6. Pool Integration

#### Pool validation approach (NO ACCESS RESTRICTION)
```solidity
/// @notice Pool does NOT restrict access - all routers can call swap
/// @dev Whitelist only affects referrer fee processing, not swap access
/// @dev NO onlyWhitelistedRouter modifier needed
```

#### Modified pool swap function (CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION)
```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IUniswapV3PoolActions
function swap(
    address recipient,
    bool zeroForOne,
    int256 amountSpecified,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    address swapReferrer,
    bytes calldata data
) external override noDelegateCall returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1) {
    require(amountSpecified != 0, 'AS');
    
    // CORE PRINCIPLE: Whitelist ONLY affects swap referrer fees
    // All swaps work normally regardless of whitelist status
    
    // DIRECT POOL SWAP HANDLING: When users call pool.swap() directly (bypassing routers),
    // msg.sender is the user/contract, not a router. This is intentionally handled by
    // treating direct swaps as non-whitelisted, so referrer fees go to protocol fees.
    // This preserves Uniswap's permissionless design while preventing fee loss.
    
    // Process swap referrer fees based on router whitelist status
    address effectiveSwapReferrer;
    bool addToProtocolFee = false;
    
    if (IUniswapV3Factory(factory).isRouterWhitelisted(msg.sender)) {
        effectiveSwapReferrer = swapReferrer;     // Whitelisted: Honor referrer address
    } else {
        effectiveSwapReferrer = address(0);       // Non-whitelisted: No referrer
        addToProtocolFee = true;                  // Add referrer fee to protocol fee
    }
    
    // ... rest of swap logic using effectiveSwapReferrer and addToProtocolFee
    // NOTE: Swap proceeds normally in both cases - only referrer fee destination differs
}
```

#### Fee Distribution Logic Implementation
```solidity
/// @notice Enhanced swap function with protocol fee accumulation for non-whitelisted routers
/// @dev ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY: This logic maintains full compatibility with Uniswap's
///      existing fee calculation and distribution patterns. It uses the same mathematical
///      approach as protocol fees and integrates seamlessly with the existing fee hierarchy.
function _processSwapReferrerFees(
    uint256 swapFeeAmount0,
    uint256 swapFeeAmount1,
    address swapReferrer,
    address router,
    bool addToProtocolFee
) internal {
    // Calculate referrer fees from swap fees
    uint256 referrerFee0 = (swapFeeAmount0 * feeSwapReferrer0) / 255;
    uint256 referrerFee1 = (swapFeeAmount1 * feeSwapReferrer1) / 255;
    
    if (addToProtocolFee) {
        // Non-whitelisted router: Add referrer fees to protocol fees
        // ARCHITECTURAL NOTE: This follows the same pattern as existing protocol fee
        // accumulation, ensuring consistency with Uniswap's fee collection mechanisms
        protocolFees.token0 += referrerFee0;
        protocolFees.token1 += referrerFee1;
        
        emit SwapReferrerFeeAddedToProtocol(router, referrerFee0, referrerFee1);
    } else if (swapReferrer != address(0)) {
        // Whitelisted router: Send referrer fees to specified referrer
        if (referrerFee0 > 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, swapReferrer, referrerFee0);
        if (referrerFee1 > 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, swapReferrer, referrerFee1);
        
        emit SwapReferrerFeePaid(router, swapReferrer, referrerFee0, referrerFee1);
    }
    
    // Remaining fees go to liquidity providers as normal
    uint256 lpFee0 = swapFeeAmount0 - referrerFee0;
    uint256 lpFee1 = swapFeeAmount1 - referrerFee1;
    
    // Distribute LP fees through normal fee growth mechanism
    _distributeLPFees(lpFee0, lpFee1);
}
```

### 7. Updated Fee Hierarchy

#### Fee Distribution Flow
With the router whitelist system, the fee distribution follows this hierarchy:

```
Total Swap Fees (100%)
├── Protocol Fee (extracted first)
├── Swap Referrer Fee (extracted second)
│   ├── Whitelisted Router → Sent to specified referrer address
│   └── Non-whitelisted Router → Added to protocol fees
└── Liquidity Provider Fee (remainder) → Distributed to positions
```

#### Fee Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Whitelisted Router**
- Total swap fee: 100 tokens
- Protocol fee (10%): 10 tokens → Protocol treasury
- Swap referrer fee (5%): 5 tokens → Referrer address
- LP fee (85%): 85 tokens → Liquidity providers

**Example 2: Non-whitelisted Router**
- Total swap fee: 100 tokens
- Protocol fee (10%): 10 tokens → Protocol treasury
- Swap referrer fee (5%): 5 tokens → **Added to protocol fees**
- LP fee (85%): 85 tokens → Liquidity providers
- **Effective protocol fee: 15 tokens total**

#### Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Fee Loss**: Swap referrer fees are never lost or wasted
2. **Protocol Revenue**: Non-whitelisted routers contribute more to protocol treasury
3. **Incentive Structure**: Encourages routers to get whitelisted for referrer benefits
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing routers continue working without changes
5. **Security**: Prevents malicious routers from extracting referrer fees

#### Economic Implications

**INTENTIONAL DESIGN NOTE**: The economic model below is carefully designed to create
positive incentives while maintaining protocol health. This is NOT a bug or oversight,
but a deliberate mechanism to encourage quality router development and generate
sustainable protocol revenue.

- **Whitelisted routers**: Standard fee structure with referrer benefits
- **Non-whitelisted routers**: Higher effective protocol fees (referrer fees go to protocol)
- **Protocol treasury**: Receives additional revenue from non-whitelisted router usage
- **Liquidity providers**: Unaffected - receive same LP fees regardless of router type

**ECONOMIC RATIONALE**: This creates a "freemium" model where basic swap access is
free/permissionless, but premium features (referrer benefits) require whitelisting.
This generates revenue to fund protocol development while maintaining core accessibility.

### 8. Router Registration Process

#### Initial router registration
```solidity
// Example deployment script
function deployAndRegisterRouter() external {
    // Deploy new router
    SwapRouter router = new SwapRouter(factory, WETH9);
    
    // Register with factory
    IUniswapV3Factory(factory).addRouterToWhitelist(address(router));
    
    // Set initial swap referrer
    router.setSwapReferrer(INITIAL_SWAP_REFERRER);
}
```

#### Batch router registration
```solidity
// Register multiple routers at once
address[] memory routers = new address[](3);
routers[0] = ROUTER_V1;
routers[1] = ROUTER_V2;
routers[2] = THIRD_PARTY_ROUTER;

IUniswapV3Factory(factory).addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist(routers);
```

### 8. Security Considerations

#### Access Control - Factory Owner Only
All router whitelist functions are protected by the `require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');` check:

- `addRouterToWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only
- `removeRouterFromWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only  
- `addMultipleRoutersToWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only
- `removeMultipleRoutersFromWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only
- `clearRouterWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only
- `emergencyRemoveRouter()` - ✅ Owner only
- `pauseWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only
- `unpauseWhitelist()` - ✅ Owner only

**View functions are public** (no access control needed):
- `isRouterWhitelisted()` - Public view
- `whitelistedRoutersCount()` - Public view
- `getAllWhitelistedRouters()` - Public view

#### Additional Security Features
- Pool validation prevents unauthorized swap referrer fee claims
- Proper event emission for transparency and monitoring
- Emergency procedures for rapid response to threats

#### Validation
- Prevent zero address routers
- Prevent duplicate whitelist entries
- Validate router addresses before adding
- Handle edge cases in list management

#### Gas Optimization
- Use mappings for O(1) whitelist checks
- Minimize storage operations
- Efficient array management for enumeration

### 9. Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency router removal
```solidity
// Quick removal of compromised router
function emergencyRemoveRouter(address router) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
    require(whitelistedRouters[router], 'ROUTER_NOT_WHITELISTED');
    
    // Immediate removal
    whitelistedRouters[router] = false;
    
    // Remove from list (simplified for emergency)
    // Full cleanup can be done later
    
    emit RouterRemovedFromWhitelist(router, msg.sender);
}
```

#### Emergency whitelist pause
```solidity
/// @notice Emergency pause for router whitelist
bool public whitelistPaused;

modifier whenWhitelistNotPaused() {
    require(!whitelistPaused, 'WHITELIST_PAUSED');
    _;
}

function pauseWhitelist() external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
    whitelistPaused = true;
}

function unpauseWhitelist() external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, 'NOT_OWNER');
    whitelistPaused = false;
}
```

### 10. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test router whitelist addition and removal
- Test batch operations
- Test access control (only owner)
- Test edge cases (zero address, duplicates)
- Test enumeration functions

#### Integration Tests
- Test pool-factory integration
- Test router validation in pools
- Test swap referrer fee processing with whitelist
- Test emergency procedures

#### Gas Analysis
- Measure gas costs for whitelist operations
- Optimize array management
- Compare different validation approaches

### 11. Monitoring and Analytics

#### Events for Tracking
- `RouterWhitelisted`: Track router additions
- `RouterRemovedFromWhitelist`: Track router removals
- `WhitelistCleared`: Track whitelist resets

#### Query Functions
- `getAllWhitelistedRouters()`: Get all approved routers
- `whitelistedRoutersCount()`: Get whitelist size
- `isRouterWhitelisted[router]`: Check specific router status

#### Off-chain Integration
- Subgraph indexing of whitelist events
- Router status monitoring
- Automated alerts for whitelist changes

### 12. Migration Strategy

#### Existing Pool Compatibility
- Existing pools continue to work without router validation
- New pools can be deployed with whitelist validation
- Gradual migration path for enabling validation

#### Router Onboarding
- Document router approval process
- Provide templates for router registration
- Create governance procedures for router approval

### 13. Alternative Implementations

#### Option 1: Strict Validation (NOT RECOMMENDED - Conflicts with Uniswap V3 Design)
- All swap referrer fee processing requires whitelisted router
- Maximum security and control
- May require router updates for compliance

**❌ Why This Option is NOT Used:**
- **Conflicts with Uniswap V3 Core Design**: Uniswap V3 is explicitly designed for permissionless access where "anyone in the world can access financial services"
- **Direct Pool Access**: Users and contracts can interact directly with pools without routers through the callback pattern
- **Router-Free Swaps**: The protocol supports direct pool swaps via `pool.swap()` without any router intermediary
- **Architectural Philosophy**: Uniswap V3 follows a core/periphery design where routers are optional convenience contracts with "no special privileges"
- **Breaking Change**: Would fundamentally alter the permissionless nature of the protocol
- **Innovation Barrier**: Would prevent new router development and direct pool integrations

**Technical Evidence:**
- Pool interfaces explicitly state "Permissionless pool actions that can be called by anyone"
- Test contracts demonstrate direct pool interaction without routers
- Core documentation emphasizes "no ability to selectively restrict who can or cannot use them"
- Callback pattern enables secure direct pool access for any smart contract

#### Option 2: Permissive with Warnings
- Allow non-whitelisted routers but emit warnings
- Gradual transition approach
- Less disruptive to existing integrations

#### Option 3: Configurable Validation
- Pool-level configuration for router validation
- Flexible but more complex
- Allows different pools to have different policies

#### Option 4: Fee Redirection (RECOMMENDED - Current Implementation)
- All routers can swap normally without restrictions
- Whitelisted routers: Swap referrer fees go to specified referrer
- Non-whitelisted routers: Swap referrer fees are added to protocol fees
- Maintains permissionless access while providing security and incentives

### 14. Governance Integration

#### DAO Proposal Template
```solidity
// Example governance proposal for router approval
function proposeRouterWhitelisting(
    address router,
    string memory description,
    bytes memory routerValidationData
) external {
    // Governance proposal logic
    // Include router validation and community review
}
```

#### Multi-sig Router Management
